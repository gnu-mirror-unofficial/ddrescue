<h4>Introduction</h4>

GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block
device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in
case of read errors.
<p>
The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't have
to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run it in reverse
mode, etc.
<p>
If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.
<p>
Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies of
a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time,
with the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and
error-free file. This is so because the probability of having damaged
areas at the same places on different input files is very low. Using
the logfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and
successive copies.
<p>
The logfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash you can
resume the rescue with little recopying.
<p>
Also, the same logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the file, and for multiple recovery attempts over
different subsets.
<p>
Ddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it can be used
to read from raw devices. For efficiency reasons, also aligns it to the
memory page size if page size is a multiple of sector size.
