<h4>Introduction</h4>

GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block
device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in
case of read errors.
<p>
Ddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So, every time
you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the gaps.
<p>
The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't have
to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run it in reverse
mode, etc.
<p>
If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.
<p>
Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies of
a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time,
with the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and
error-free file. This is so because the probability of having damaged
areas at the same places on different input files is very low. Using
the logfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and
successive copies.
<p>
The logfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash you can
resume the rescue with little recopying.
<p>
Also, the same logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the file, and for multiple recovery attempts over
different subsets.

For other ways to obtain ddrescue, please read
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html#HowToGetSoftware">How
to get GNU Software</a>. The latest released version will be the latest
version available here at <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ddrescue/">
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ddrescue/</a>.
<p>
Old versions (and sometimes the latest version if upload to

<p>
Testing versions of alpha releases can be found on the alpha release
server. A different server is used for alpha releases so that people do
not confuse testing snapshots and released versions. Alpha test versions
are available at <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ddrescue/">
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ddrescue/</a>.
