<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying to rescue the
good parts first in case of read errors.
<p>
Ddrescuelog is a tool that manipulates ddrescue mapfiles, shows mapfile
contents, converts mapfiles to/from other formats, compares mapfiles,
tests rescue status, and can delete a mapfile if the rescue is done.
Ddrescuelog operations can be restricted to one or several parts of the
mapfile if the domain setting options are used.
<p>
The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't
have to wait for an error, stop the program, restart it from a new
position, etc.
<p>
If you use the mapfile feature of ddrescue, the data are rescued very
efficiently, (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point. The
mapfile is an essential part of ddrescue's effectiveness. Use it unless
you know what you are doing.
<p>
Ddrescue does not write zeros to the output when it finds bad sectors in
the input, and does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So,
every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the
gaps without wiping out the data already rescued.
<p>
Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies of
a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with
the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and error-free
file. This is so because the probability of having the same area damaged
in all copies is low (if the errors are randomly located). Using the
mapfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and successive
copies.
<p>
Ddrescue recommends <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html">lzip</a>
for compression of backups because the lzip format is designed for long-term
archiving and provides data recovery capabilities which nicely complement
those of ddrescue. (Ddrescue fills unreadable sectors with data from other
copies, while lziprecover corrects corrupt sectors with data from other
copies). If the cause of file corruption is damaged media, the combination
ddrescue&nbsp;+&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lziprecover.html">lziprecover</a>
is the best option for recovering data from multiple damaged copies.
<p>
Recordable CD and DVD media keep their data only for a finite time
(typically for some years). After that time, data loss develops slowly
with read errors growing from the outer media region towards the inside.
Just make two (or more) copies of every important CD-ROM/DVD you burn so
that you can later recover them with ddrescue.
<p>
The mapfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash you can
resume the rescue with little recopying.
<p>
Also, the same mapfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the file, and for multiple recovery attempts over
different subsets.
<p>
Ddrescue also features a "fill mode" able to selectively overwrite parts
of the output file, which has a number of interesting uses like wiping
data, marking bad areas or even, in some cases, "repair" damaged
sectors.
<p>
One of the great strengths of ddrescue is that it is interface-agnostic,
and so can be used for any kind of device supported by your kernel (ATA,
SATA, SCSI, old MFM drives, floppy discs, or even flash media cards like
SD).

<p>
To decompress ddrescue tarballs you may need lzip from
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html">
http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html</a>.
Then use "<code>tar&nbsp;-xf&nbsp;ddrescue[version].tar.lz</code>" or
"<code>lzip&nbsp;-cd&nbsp;ddrescue[version].tar.lz&nbsp;|&nbsp;tar&nbsp;-xf&nbsp;-</code>"
to extract the files.
