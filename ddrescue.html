<h3>ddrescue</h3>

ddrescue copies data from one file or block device (hard disk, cdrom,
etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors.
<p>
ddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So, everytime
you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the gaps.
<p>
If you have two or more copies of a damaged file, cdrom, etc, and run
ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with the same output file, you
will probably obtain a complete and error-free file. This is so because
the probability of having damaged areas at the same places on different
input files is very low.
<p>
if you also use the bad blocks file feature of ddrescue, the data will
be rescued very efficiently.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm</h4>

The algorithm of ddrescue is as follows:
<p>
  1) Read the non-damaged part of the disk, skipping the damaged areas.<br>
or<br>
  1) Read a list of bad blocks (damaged areas) from a file.<br>
<p>
  2) Try to read the damaged areas, splitting them into smaller pieces
     and reading the non-damaged pieces, until the hardware block size
     is reached, or until interrupted by the user.
<p>
  3) Try to read the damaged hardware blocks until the specified number
     of retries is reached, or until interrupted by the user.
<p>
  4) Optionally write a list of bad blocks to a file.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

Infinite retrying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue --max-retries=-1 infile outfile
<p>
Reading from CD-ROM with physical sector size of 2048 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue --block-size=2048 /dev/cdrom outfile
<p>
Efficient rescue from several identical (but independent) sources<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue infile1 outfile bbfile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue infile2 outfile bbfile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue infile3 outfile bbfile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  (repeat until all blocks are copied to outfile (ddrescue deletes bbfile))
<p>
Complex rescue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue infile outfile bbfile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  (edit bbfile and move the desired entries to bbfile2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ddrescue --max-retries=-1 infile outfile bbfile2
